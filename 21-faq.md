## 🔧 Algorithm Understanding

### Q: How does A* differ from Dijkstra's algorithm?
**A:** Key differences:

| Aspect | Dijkstra's | A* |
|--------|------------|----|
| **Guidance** | Explores uniformly | Uses heuristic to guide search |
| **Performance** | Slower, explores more nodes | Faster, more focused |
| **Optimality** | Always optimal | Optimal with admissible heuristic |
| **Use case** | When no goal direction known | When goal location is known |

A* = Dijkstra's + heuristic guidance. See [Search Algorithms](02-search-algorithms.md) for detailed comparison.

### Q: What makes a heuristic "admissible"?
**A:** An admissible heuristic **never overestimates** the actual cost to reach the goal:
- **h(n) ≤ actual_cost(n, goal)** for all nodes n
- **Examples:** Manhattan distance for grid movement, Euclidean distance for any movement
- **Why important:** Guarantees A* finds optimal path
- **Common mistake:** Using heuristics that overestimate

See [Heuristic Mathematics](03-heuristic-mathematics.md) for detailed explanation and proofs.

### Q: What's the difference between admissible and consistent heuristics?
**A:** 
- **Admissible:** Never overestimates total cost to goal
- **Consistent (Monotonic):** Satisfies triangle inequality: h(n) ≤ cost(n,n') + h(n')
- **Relationship:** All consistent heuristics are admissible, but not vice versa
- **Practical impact:** Consistent heuristics are more efficient (no node re-expansion)
- **Most common heuristics** (Manhattan, Euclidean) are both admissible and consistent

### Q: Why does A* use f(n) = g(n) + h(n)?
**A:** This formula balances two important factors:
- **g(n)** - Actual cost from start (ensures we don't ignore distance traveled)
- **h(n)** - Estimated cost to goal (guides search toward target)
- **f(n)** - Total estimated cost of path through node n
- **Result:** Explores most promising nodes first while maintaining optimality

See [Node Evaluation](04-node-evaluation.md) for step-by-step examples.

## 💻 Implementation Questions

### Q: What data structures should I use for A*?
**A:** Essential data structures:

| Component | Best Structure | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Open Set** | Min-Heap (Priority Queue) | Efficiently get lowest f-cost node |
| **Closed Set** | Hash Set | Fast O(1) membership testing |
| **Grid** | 2D Array | Direct coordinate access |
| **Path** | Array or Linked List | Store final path sequence |

See [Set Management](05-set-management.md) for implementations and alternatives.

### Q: How do I handle diagonal movement?
**A:** Two approaches:

**8-Directional Movement:**
- **Cost:** √2 ≈ 1.414 for diagonals, 1.0 for orthogonal
- **Heuristic:** Euclidean or Chebyshev distance
- **Use case:** More realistic movement

**4-Directional Movement:**
- **Cost:** 1.0 for all moves (up, down, left, right)
- **Heuristic:** Manhattan distance
- **Use case:** Grid-based games, simpler implementation

See [Graph Theory Basics](01-graph-theory-basics.md#movement-types) for details.

### Q: How do I prevent A* from cutting corners?
**A:** Corner-cutting occurs when diagonal movement passes through blocked cells. Solutions:

1. **Check intermediate cells:**
   ```javascript
   function canMoveDiagonally(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
       return !isBlocked(x1, y2) && !isBlocked(x2, y1);
   }
   ```

2. **Use line-of-sight checks:**
   ```javascript
   function hasLineOfSight(start, end) {
       // Bresenham's line algorithm
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Jump Point Search** for more sophisticated handling

See [Complete Implementation](07-complete-implementation.md) for full examples.

### Q: How do I handle dynamic obstacles?
**A:** Several approaches:

**Simple Re-planning:**
- Detect obstacle change
- Re-run A* from current position
- **Pros:** Simple to implement
- **Cons:** Computationally expensive

**D* (Dynamic A*):**
- Incrementally update path when obstacles change
- **Pros:** More efficient for frequent changes
- **Cons:** More complex implementation

**Local Repair:**
- Only re-plan affected path segments
- **Pros:** Good balance of simplicity and efficiency

See [Advanced Topics](14-advanced-topics.md#dynamic-a-d) for D* implementation.

## 🎮 Practical Applications

### Q: How do I integrate A* into a game?
**A:** Common integration patterns:

**Real-time Games:**
```javascript
class GameEntity {
    update(deltaTime) {
        if (this.needsNewPath) {
            this.path = pathfinder.findPath(this.pos, this.target);
            this.needsNewPath = false;
        }
        this.followPath(deltaTime);
    }
}
```

**Turn-based Games:**
```javascript
function planTurn(unit, targetPosition) {
    const path = pathfinder.findPath(unit.position, targetPosition);
    return createMoveActions(path);
}
```

See [Applications](08-applications.md#game-development) for complete examples.

### Q: How do I optimize A* for real-time performance?
**A:** Key optimization strategies:

1. **Limit search time:**
   ```javascript
   const MAX_NODES = 1000;
   let nodesExplored = 0;
   while (openSet.length > 0 && nodesExplored < MAX_NODES) {
       // A* iteration
       nodesExplored++;
   }
   ```

2. **Use hierarchical pathfinding:**
   - High-level path between regions
   - Low-level path within regions

3. **Cache and reuse paths:**
   - Store recently computed paths
   - Validate cached paths before reuse

4. **Optimize data structures:**
   - Use efficient priority queue
   - Minimize memory allocations

See [Optimizations](09-optimizations.md) for detailed techniques.

### Q: How many units can A* handle simultaneously?
**A:** Depends on several factors:

**Single-threaded JavaScript:**
- **Small grids (50x50):** 10-20 units at 60 FPS
- **Medium grids (200x200):** 5-10 units at 60 FPS
- **Large grids (1000x1000):** 1-3 units at 60 FPS

**Optimization techniques:**
- **Time-slicing:** Spread pathfinding across multiple frames
- **Hierarchical pathfinding:** Reduce search space
- **Path sharing:** Multiple units use same high-level path
- **Web Workers:** Offload pathfinding to background threads

See [Performance](13-performance.md) for benchmarking and optimization.

## 🐛 Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Q: My A* implementation doesn't find the optimal path. What's wrong?
**A:** Common causes:

1. **Non-admissible heuristic:**
   ```javascript
   // Wrong: Overestimates
   function badHeuristic(a, b) {
       return Math.abs(a.x - b.x) + Math.abs(a.y - b.y) * 2; // Too high!
   }
   
   // Correct: Admissible
   function manhattanDistance(a, b) {
       return Math.abs(a.x - b.x) + Math.abs(a.y - b.y);
   }
   ```

2. **Incorrect movement costs:**
   ```javascript
   // Wrong: All moves cost 1
   const cost = 1;
   
   // Correct: Diagonal costs √2
   const cost = isDiagonal ? Math.sqrt(2) : 1;
   ```

3. **Early termination:**
   ```javascript
   // Wrong: Stop when goal is added to open set
   if (neighbor === goal) return reconstructPath(goal);
   
   // Correct: Stop when goal is selected from open set
   if (current === goal) return reconstructPath(goal);
   ```

### Q: A* is too slow. How do I speed it up?
**A:** Performance optimization checklist:

1. **Profile first:** Identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Optimize data structures:** Use efficient priority queue
3. **Reduce memory allocations:** Reuse objects
4. **Limit search space:** Use bounds or time limits
5. **Consider alternatives:** JPS, hierarchical pathfinding
6. **Use better heuristics:** More informed estimates

See [Performance](13-performance.md) for detailed analysis.

### Q: A* finds paths through walls. How do I fix this?
**A:** Check obstacle detection:

```javascript
// Ensure proper boundary checking
function isValidPosition(x, y) {
    return x >= 0 && x < gridWidth && 
           y >= 0 && y < gridHeight && 
           !grid[y][x].isObstacle;
}

// For diagonal movement, check intermediate cells
function canMoveDiagonally(fromX, fromY, toX, toY) {
    if (!isValidPosition(toX, toY)) return false;
    
    // Check if diagonal movement cuts through obstacles
    return isValidPosition(fromX, toY) && isValidPosition(toX, fromY);
}
```

### Q: How do I debug A* visually?
**A:** Use our [Interactive Demo](demo.html) or add visualization:

```javascript
function visualizeSearch(openSet, closedSet, current) {
    // Color nodes based on their state
    openSet.forEach(node => colorNode(node, 'green'));
    closedSet.forEach(node => colorNode(node, 'red'));
    colorNode(current, 'blue');
    
    // Display f, g, h values
    displayNodeCosts(current);
}
```
